# Student Kit

Student Kit is an app with features tailored to students. Have some tasks to do throughout the day, we got you covered 👍. Use the Todos to plan them out. In between a online class, no hassle to reach out for sheets of paper, just use the Notes to note the important points📓. Do you have an assignment you just don't want to miss the due date for ?, just chill out. Use the Events Management section and add an event and never miss a due date 📅. Let me guess, you also have some important files like some sample question papers or notes that you borrowed, just upload it to the File Management Section and download it whenever you need it 📁. Also benefit from the other features like the Calculator🧮 and a Clock with weather information ⏰.
